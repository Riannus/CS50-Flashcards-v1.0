# Flashcards  

#### Video Demo: [Watch Here](https://youtu.be/4CTJjVHR3PM)  

## Overview  

**Flashcards** is a Python-based application developed as the final project for *CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python*. The app enables users to create, manage, and interact with flashcard decks, designed for learning and reviewing information effectively.  

## Features  
- **Custom Decks**: Create flashcard decks by defining terms and corresponding definitions.  
- **Deck Browser**: View, edit, or delete existing flashcard decks.  
- **Game Modes**: Play several games to memorize your custom flashcards.
  - **Quiz Mode**: Match the term with its definition.
  - **Guess the Definition**: Multiple-choice mode (A, B, C, D).
  - **Survival Mode**: An endless quiz mode.
- **Study Mode**: A relaxed mode where users can go through their flashcards without penalties. Cards can also be edited directly in this mode.
- **CSV-Based Storage**: Flashcard decks are stored in easily accessible CSV files for management and sharing.  
- **Default Decks**: Includes a preloaded decks for immediate gameplay.

## Design Decisions  
- **CSV for Data Storage**: Chosen for its simplicity and ease of use, given the small scale of the project.  
- **Command-Line Interface**: A terminal-based menu system ensures a straightforward user experience without requiring additional dependencies for graphical interfaces.  
- **Error Handling**: User inputs are validated to ensure a smooth experience, including standardized inputs for terms and definitions to avoid case-sensitivity issues.
- **Dynamic Text System**: All in-game texts are stored in a JSON file, making it easy to modify or expand without altering the source code.

## Future Features  
Planned enhancements include:  
1. **Database Integration**: Replace CSV storage with a more robust database system.  
2. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Add a user-friendly graphical interface.  
3. **Deck Enhancements**:  
   - Rename decks.  
   - Mark decks as favorites.  
   - Delete individual cards from decks.  
4. **Game Mode Settings**:  
   - Match either terms or definitions.  
   - Add a time limit for answers.  
   - Enable or disable case-sensitivity.  
5. **New Game Modes**: Implement a memory game (e.g., matching pairs).
